						<h3>Group Process</h3>
						<p>In Assignment 2, all group members made a significant contribution to the group project.
							Firstly, the atmosphere of our group was quite harmonious and cooperative. As group members
							were unique individuals, it was common to hold different opinions while working together.
							However, we always had a small discussion at first, and then we voted to make a decision
							which was the most effective way to solve conflicts. Secondly, although the group project
							had a heavy workload, all group members assigned the large amount of work equally and
							rationally. Even if group members completed their parts early, they volunteered to help
							others if they had any difficulties in the project. We would like to persist these
							outstanding contributions in our next group assignment. Conversely, there are also some
							improvements that we can make in Assignment 3. The most important thing that we need to
							enhance is time management. Because it is close to the final term, we should reasonably
							schedule and plan our timetable in order to complete all assignments effectively with
							advanced quality. Additionally, a new group member joins our team in Assignment 3. We should
							adapt to the slight changes as soon as possible. It is crucial to build a reliable and tied
							bond with new group members which can boost our efficiency in a project.</p>

					<h1>
						Overview
					</h1>
					<h2>
						Topic
					</h2>
					<p>
						Online education refers to the method of content dissemination and rapid learning through the
						application of information technology and internet technology. In recent years, the development
						of hardware devices, online real-time transmission technology has driven the rapid development
						of online education. At present, the technology of online education is mainly based on
						interactive platforms and intelligent systems. And with the continuous development of
						technology, more and more technologies are applied to online education platforms to optimize the
						teaching experience and effectiveness of the platforms and promote the upgrading of products and
						services in the online education industry.
					</p>
					<p>
						Compared to traditional offline education methods, online education can break the constraints of
						time and space, meet the needs of consumers to obtain education in fragmented time, and make up
						for the shortcomings of traditional education learning time and place inflexibility. The
						application of artificial intelligence, big data and other technologies in the internet
						education industry can enable educators to grasp the learning situation of users in real time
						and accurately. Under the premise of resource sharing, users have a high degree of freedom in
						choosing education brands and teaching styles.
					</p>
					<h2>
						Motivation
					</h2>
					<p>
						In the first half of 2020, influenced by the COVID-19, the penetration rate of the online
						education industry increased significantly. Over 1.2 billion youngsters are out of school
						worldwide. The epidemic has brought forward the overall process of the online education industry
						by three to five years. The online education industry has seen a significant increase in
						penetration, opening the valve for users to shift from offline to online and change their
						behavioural habits. Meanwhile, the penetration of big data and AI technologies in education will
						continue to deepen. Online learning industry became the focus of capital development, and the
						major Internet giants also accelerated their entry into the game.
					</p>
					<h2>
						Landscape
					</h2>
					<p>
						Recently, there are many established online education platforms which are already in the market
						and widely used, such as Udemy, Coursera and Skillshare. However, the challenges also exist for
						online institutions in promoting online learning and teaching. Firstly, the pressure on the
						server multiplied during the epidemic, and the live streaming lag, delay and crash phenomenon
						affect the teaching effect. Secondly, poor interactivity in online classes and lack of feedback
						and analysis systems make it difficult to guarantee teaching quality. For our new online
						learning platforms, we will devote ourselves to creating optimization systems in order to deal
						with basic technical issues such as delayed transmission and video lag.

					<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
					<h4 class="subtitle">What does it do?</h4>
					<p>Cybersecurity means that the software and hardware of the data in the system and the network
						system are saved from being leaked, changed, or damaged by unexpected or vicious reasons. With a
						tried and continuous operation of the network service and the system can not be broken down.
					</p>
					<p>Network firewall technology is a particular interconnection network equipment, which is used to
						enhance the access control between networks, hinder the users of the outer network from
						iniquitously entering the internal network through the external network, access to the internal
						network resources, and protect the internal network operating environment. It checks packets
						transmitted between two or more networks, such as link patterns, according to inevitable
						security policies, to decide if the telecommunications between networks is allowed or not, and
						invigilators the working state of the network.</p>
					<p>At present, the firewall products mainly include fortress host, packet filter router,
						application layer gateway, circuit layer gateway, shielding host firewall, dual host, etc.
						Anti-virus software is definitely the most widely used security technology solution because the
						technology is the easiest to implement, but we all know is the main function of antivirus
						software antivirus, the function is very limited, can not fully meet the needs of network
						security, this way maybe can meet the needs of individuals or small businesses, but if
						individuals or businesses have the demand of electronic commerce, It can't be completely
						satisfied.
					</p>
					<p>Fortunately, with the continuous development of anti-virus software technology, the current
						mainstream anti-virus software can prevent the Trojan horse and other hacker programs. Other
						antivirus software developers also provide a software firewall, with a certain firewall
						function, to a certain extent can play the role of a hardware firewall, such as KV300, Golden
						Mountain firewall, Norton firewall, and so on.</p>
					<p>The security technology used in combination with firewall includes file encryption and digital
						signature technology, its purpose is to improve the security and confidentiality of information
						systems and data. One of the primary technical means to prevent secret data from being stolen,
						intercepted, or destroyed by outsiders. With the development of information technology, people
						be more and more concentrate on network security and information confidentiality.</p>
					<p>At present, in accretion to enhancing data security safeguard in law and management, countries
						have also taken estimates in hardware and software technology respectively. It promotes the
						continuous improvement of data encryption skills and physical protection skills. According to
						the different functions, file encryption and digital signature technology basically include data
						transmission, data storage, data integrity discrimination, and so on.</p>
					<p>Artificial intelligence technology will be the focus of the next round of technological
						revolution. With the rapid development of AI and other technologies, the resulting security
						problems are more of a priority for our network security industry. Similar to artificial
						intelligence technology, blockchain is also listed as an important emerging technology. In the
						current network security industry, its two sides are very obvious. In contrast, the network
						defense of blockchain is also recognized in the industry, and it is reported that it is the
						second line of defense in the network security industry. The ensuing blockchain security,
						ecological security, information security, etc., have also become more obvious and complex. Its
						regulation has lagged behind the pace of development and has caused numerous safety problems.
						Quantum technology is now also threatening the security of traditional encryption algorithms.
						Quantum communication and quantum computing are the two most widely used technologies in the
						field of network security, and they are most closely related to network security. 5G technology
						has officially entered the commercial stage, and its network security threats will also be
						derived from new security technologies. The Internet of Things has been a safe disaster area.
						The complementary and coordinated development of cloud computing, edge computing, and fog
						computing will also have an impact on the security industry.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">What is the likely impact?</h4>
					<p>Cybersecurity is important because the amount of data that governments, the military,
						corporations, monetary and iatrical organizations gather in, store, and process on computers and
						other devices are unprecedented. A significant part of this data could be serious information,
						whether literary property, monetary data, personal detail, or other types of data, where illegal
						employment or reveal can have negative results. Companies transfer sensitive data over networks
						or other equipment in the course of their business, and cybersecurity describes the discipline
						of defending that data and the systems used to process or store it. As the scale and complexity
						of cyber hacking increase, organizations and companies, peculiarly those reliable for protecting
						data related to national security, medical, or monetary archives, need to take action to secure
						their sensitive commerce and individual information. America's top intelligence staff have
						warned that cyber strikes and electronic espionage are the most serious intimidation to state
						security, eclipsing even terrorism.</p>
					<p>New technologies in the cybersecurity industry are either research in nature, national strategy,
						or market-driven. These three pieces should be the main source of driving force for new
						technologies in network security.</p>
					<p>In terms of the nature of research, the vulnerability research technologies and methods at the
						system level emerge in an endless stream. With the iteration of versions and the update of
						hardware technology, many new injection reverse methods and vulnerability mining technologies
						have emerged from the traditional Windows to iOS and Android.</p>
					<p>From the perspective of national strategy, cyberspace confrontation and interference between
						countries will promote security methods and countermeasures at all levels from terminals to
						networks to systems to tools, as well as new ideas and technologies such as DNS pollution, BGP
						hijacking, and software intrusion.</p>
					<p>Driven from the market, is the apparent compliance and forced to promote market-oriented domestic
						technical generation and development, compliance-driven from a full business chain from upstream
						to downstream, the technology is accurate for the security services technology, technology
						itself is not necessarily the security, the security of the code is most concerned about, market
						behavior is more meet compliance requirements, At the same time, as far as possible to their
						problems, so, from code static to business dynamic self-protection and other related to the user
						business, in the confrontation has been developing.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">How will this affect you?</h4>
					<p>While work-at-home attacks are not a new threat, it is only a matter of time before an attacker
						can infiltrate multiple, insecure home networks simultaneously, wreaking havoc on critical
						systems and services. It makes sense. With many employees using their home broadband connections
						for personal and work purposes, the scope for corporate attacks has increased considerably.</p>
					<p>Data reveals can contain economic information such as credit card numbers or bank account
						details, personal health detail, individually identifiable information, trade secrets,
						intellectual property. Other ways for data breach include unintentional, data breach, cloud
						breach, information breach.</p>
					<p>When we join a public Wi-Fi, we usually reveal the risk of stealing personal detail from an
						external source. For example, some hackers on the network are able to access our devices to grab
						our personal detail. They range from so-called "man-in-the-middle" attacks to attacks that
						create bogus Wi-Fi to collect data. In what is known as a "man-in-the-middle" attack, the
						connection between a user and a Wi-Fi will be hackers broken to steal private information. While
						the fake Wi-Fi networks are ones that hackers create, they will look really alike to a
						reasonable connection.</p>
					<p>Those hackers have access to reasonable names for Wi-Fi networks that look like what a business
						network would connect. For example, when the actual name of the network is "Starbucks Guest,"
						they may set a name like "Starbucks Guest."Hackers could use these networks to collect illegal
						data from those people who connect this connection. </p>

					<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
					<h4 class="subtitle">What does it do?</h4>
					<p>The autonomous vehicle is a kind of intelligent vehicle, also known as a wheeled mobile robot. It
						mainly relies on the computer system in the car, to reach the target of driving without the
						driver. The autonomous vehicle is a smart vehicle that able to latches the road environment by
						the onboard sensing system, plans the driving guidelines by the computers, and controls the
						vehicle to reach the scheduled target. Like so much else, Autonomous driving is a process of
						gradual technological development. There are also different stages of Autonomous driving.
					</p>
					<p>Stage one: the auxiliary driving stage. adaptive cruise, Lane-keeping, and other support driving
						capabilities are the technologies that we have at this stage, however, the navigator still is
						the main operator.</p>
					<p>Stage two: semi-autonomous. At this stage, the autonomous vehicle already can project the process
						of going to the destination in the computer calculation, and it also could serve as a backup
						system to support during the driving. However, due to the restriction of regulations and laws
						and other factors, it still can not occur as the main part of the driving.</p>
					<p>Stage three: Full self-driving. Technology, law, cost, and other factors cease to influence the
						popularity of the opportunities, computer control system has been the driving subject, the
						driver could take charge of the operating system anytime.</p>
					<p>Concerning automatic parking, the cause of vehicle damage is not a recurrent road accident, but a
						minor bump caused by parking. Parking can be the least critical driving behavior, but it may
						still make everything messy. Although several automakers are adding rear-view cameras and
						accelerometers that scale the distance of objects around them and through onboard computers that
						able to display what's on the sides of the car however some drivers are still bumping their way
						into parking spaces.</p>
					<p>The autonomous parking system is a major milestone of autonomous vehicles. With this system, the
						car is able to look into its surroundings similar to a driver, work at the right moment and
						travel securely from stop 1 to stop 2. While the technology isn't yet fully hands-off and
						letting the car drive you home, it's the first step in that direction.</p>
					<p>Since DARPA's ALV project in the 1980s, the most popular self-driving techniques we've seen are
						studded with sensors and have a lidar mounted on top of them. The vehicle uses sensors to detect
						and three-dimensional scans of lidar to 'sense' the world around it, while the onboard
						controlling computer acts like a human brain to decide what to do. Google's Autonomous vehicles
						are a good sample of lidar exhibitions.</p>
					<p>Google is regarded as the earliest Internet giant to Interdisciplinary to carry out the
						examination and exploit of autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, depending on their own map and big
						data computing resources, they really contain a leading benefit in this field. Google's
						autonomous vehicles use a 64-bit 3D lidar provided by Velodyne to create a 3D map of their
						circumstance. Combined with Google's senior-fidelity maps, Google's self-driving car uses a
						computer and a cloud network to process big data. Finally, realize the automatic driving
						function:</p>
					<p>Early test vehicles of the Toyota Prius were furnished with position sensors, range-ranging
						radar, video cameras, and lidar. Video cameras are used to estimate any traveling targets and
						traffic lights. LiDAR is also used to make 3D maps of actual highway conditions; Ranging radar
						is used to explore barriers on sides of the car. When a target approaches, the computer will
						voluntarily decrease the speed of the vehicle. The location transducer located on the left rear
						wheel detects and estimates the lateral deviation of the car to condition its position on the
						map.</p>
					<p>After years of efforts, Google has publicity its demo Autonomous vehicle. The sample is also
						loaded with radar and transducers, as much as a lidar installed on the top of the vehicle.
						Google's Autonomous vehicle, which has removed the steering wheel and is drive completely by an
						onboard computer, is the optimal thing even to an Autonomous car concept.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">What is the likely impact?</h4>
					<p>Professional drivers will be drastically reduced. Autonomous cars will reduce the need for truck
						drivers, taxi drivers, and other professional drivers. The human cost of large bus and truck
						drivers is not a small expenditure, and can not let each driver work too hard, work too long, to
						avoid the bad consequences of fatigue driving, and unmanned driving can be very good to
						alleviate or even solve this problem.</p>
					<p>Autonomous cars have reduced the traffic accident rate. There are statistics show that 1,200,000
						person die every single year from all over the world automotive or related to traffic accidents,
						of which 93% is caused by human error, and unmanned vehicles using on-board sensors to the
						surrounding environment, and according to the perceived position of road vehicles and obstacles
						of information control steering and speed of the vehicle, the vehicle on the road can safely and
						reliably and It can reduce the number of road accidents caused by careless mistakes and reduce
						the number of people killed.</p>
					<p>In many American cities, however, there are concerns that the development of autonomous driving
						will ruin their economies. These cities rely on revenue from car use to balance their budgets,
						which can amount to 15 to 50 percent of their city's transportation revenue: gasoline taxes,
						vehicle registration fees, and billions of dollars in parking revenue. But Autonomous cars do
						not incur these costs, and the city's finances will be in a large deficit. If the government is
						asked to bear the cost, it will certainly affect the investment in other public services.
						Therefore, they call on the government to stop the deployment of Autonomous cars. Others worry
						that, contrary to the large number of jobs created by Uber, Autonomous cars may make many newly
						paid drivers lose their jobs.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">How will this affect you?</h4>
					<p>Autonomous cars free up hands and save more personal time. With time not wasted driving, waiting
						for traffic lights, or looking for a parking space, we can use the extra commute time to check
						email, grab a coffee, take a nap, or video chat with a friend far away. Women can wake up later
						and move makeup and breakfast time to the car.</p>
					<p>No more worrying about look for a car park. The proliferation of Autonomous cars means we won't
						have to search for a parking space, as they will drive themselves to find the perfect spot after
						delivering us to our destination. Even if we buy an Autonomous car, we don't need to park
						because it can find a spot and park itself. This will alleviate the shortage of parking spaces
						in the city to a large extent.</p>
					<p>The private car may be on its way out. When the entire unmanned driving technology has been
						mature and applied to the public transport system, all the traffic will be uniformly scheduled
						in a system. When you need a car, the system will allocate the nearest car to pick you up at
						intervals. It is similar to the sharing concept of Uber. When you need a car, a shared
						Autonomous car will come to help you complete the travel request. For example, after you buy the
						weekend groceries, the Autonomous car that just sent you home will pick up the elderly people
						next door to the hospital immediately.</p>
					<p>Autonomous cars are used to shuttle children to various extracurricular activities after school.
						The car is equipped with monitors that allow parents to keep an eye on their children. Parents
						may prefer Autonomous cars to strangers picking up and dropping off their children.</p>
					<p>Autonomous cars have also appeared, with the main benefit of making roads safer. People who are
						elderly or unable to drive could also benefit from Autonomous cars.</p>

					<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
					<h4 class="subtitle">What does it do?</h4>
					<p>Technological innovation is the fundamental driving force of economic growth. The most important
						thing of these technologies is what economists refer to as "general-purpose technologies" such
						as the internal combustion engine, the steam engine, electricity, and so on. Artificial
						intelligence is undoubtedly the most important "general-purpose technology" of our era.
						Especially the combination of artificial intelligence and industry has released the potential of
						the industry and change our lives.</p>
					<p>"Machine learning" is the most important driving force behind the revolutionary advances in the
						field of artificial intelligence that has received so much attention.</p>
					<p>Machine learning is an interdisciplinary subject, which involves decision theory, algorithm
						complexity theory, experimental science, function approximation theory, optimization theory,
						cybernetics, computer science, probability statistics, and other disciplines. Therefore, there
						are many different definitions of machine learning, each of which is defined from the
						perspective of related disciplines. But in general, the core issue of its concern is how to
						simulate human-like learning behavior computationally: to take the rules (or models) from
						historical experience and apply them to new and similar scenarios.</p>
					<p>Decision trees and their variants are algorithms that divide the input area into many different
						regions, and each region has its independent parameters. The decision tree algorithm makes the
						best of the tree model, the root node to a leaf node is a separate classification of the path
						rules, each leaf node represents an independent judgment category. The samples are first divided
						into different parts, and then the segmentation recursion is executed until each subset gets
						samples of the same type. The prediction category can be gotten by starting the test from the
						root node to the subtree and then to the leaf node. This method has a simple structure and high
						efficiency of data processing.</p>
					<p>An artificial neural network is similar to an unusually complex network of neurons, consisting of
						individual interconnected units, each of which has a numerical input and output, either in the
						form of a real number or a linear combination function. It has to learn in a discipline of
						learning before it can work. When a network makes a wrong judgment, it can learn to make it less
						likely to make the same mistake. This method has strong generalization ability and nonlinear
						mapping ability and can model the system with little information. From the point of view of
						functional simulation, it has parallelism, and the speed of information transmission is
						extremely fast.</p>
					<p>In the process of machine learning, parameter estimation methods such as maximum likelihood
						estimation are needed. In the case of potential variables, the EM algorithm is usually chosen,
						which does not directly estimate the maximum of the function object but adds some data for
						simplified calculation and then carries out maximization simulation. It is a maximum likelihood
						estimation algorithm for data that are limited by the experience or difficult to be processed
						directly in the field of machine learning, deep learning is a recent research direction, which
						is presented into machine learning to achieve it closer to the initial target artificial
						intelligence (AI).</p>
					<p>The purpose of deep learning is to study the inherent rules and representation steps of a sample
						target, and the information captured during the process of studying is a benefit for helping the
						explanation of data such as words, graphs, and voice. The final aim is for machines to be as
						thinking and studying as real humans, can identify those data are collected such as texts,
						photos, and voices. Deep learning is a sophisticated machine learning arithmetic that has far
						overcome antecedent technologies in voice and graph identification.</p>
					<p>Deep learning has already achieved several efforts in search skills, natural language processing,
						machine learning, multimedia learning, data mining, machine translation, individuation
						technologies, big data analysis, and recommendation, voice identifies, and other related fields.
						Deep learning empowers machines to simulate human activities such as audio-visual and make
						choice, settles several hard pattern identification issues, and realizes significantly
						improvement in artificial intelligence-related technologies.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">What is the likely impact?</h4>
					<p>The IT giants are deeply studying and applying machine learning, aiming to fully imitate the
						human brain, in an attempt to create machine brains with human intelligence.</p>
					<p>In 2012, Google issued epochal manufacture in the area of artificial intelligence, a demic brain
						emulation software with self-learning abilities. Emulation brain cell communication and learn to
						recognize dogs, humans, and other kinds of stuff by observing YouTube videos. When data is
						passed to this neural network, the connections between different neurons influence. This also
						affords the neural network to learn how to react to some data. The connection is knowing to have
						learned something, and Google is anticipated to utilize the ultramodern technology in several
						fields, with speech identification likely to benefit first.</p>
					<p>As genomes and other sorting programs run on to expand, the center of bioinformatics research is
						removaling from backlogging information to enplaning it. after a short while, discoveries in
						biology will rely quite on our analytical capacity to combine and correlate varying data across
						multiple magnitudes and at different scales, instead of just sustained to concern on
						conventional areas. order data will be comprehensive with configuration and functional data on
						gene utterance, biochemical mechanism data on phenotype, and clinical data. With such a
						significant number of data, there is an emergency need for the improvement of academic
						arithmetic and software in the repository, procurement, processing, look through, and imagery of
						biological information. on the side, because of the sophistication of genome data itself, there
						is an emergency necessity for the improvement of academic arithmetic and software. nevertheless,
						machine learning methods such as genetic algorithms neural networks, neural networks, support
						vector machines, and decision trees are appropriate for behavior with such areas with a
						significant number of data, noise, and lack of unified theory.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">How will this affect you?</h4>
					<p>You can use spoken commands to ask the phone to perform tasks such as searching or making calls,
						and these functions rely on machine learning. Virtual personal assistants such as Siri, Alexa,
						and Google Assistant are all able to follow spoken commands because they recognize speech. They
						can process natural human language and match it with expected instructions and responses in
						increasingly natural ways. These intelligent assistants can learn a lot of conversations in
						different ways. They can be asked for specific information, such as how to read your name or
						identify the owner of a voice in a room. A large number of conversations from the users they use
						become sample data to help an intelligent assistant identify words that sound different, or how
						to create a natural discussion.</p>
					<p>Many of us are already familiar with shopping recommendations, such as supermarkets reminding you
						to add cheese to an online store or Amazon suggesting books you might like. Machine learning
						allows Amazon to offer recommendations to individual shoppers through what's called a
						recommendation system. By analyzing users' previous shopping data and various preference
						expressions, the recommendation system can record users' purchasing history patterns. They use
						this model to predict what you're likely to buy.</p>
					<p>Machine learning can also be used to distinguish between different labels of items or objects.
						Artificial intelligence is playing an important role in filtering out spam emails. This
						technique is especially beneficial for sorting out the emails you ask from the ones you don't
						want to read. Spam discovery systems can use sample mail to filter spam and identify spam by
						finding specific words, names of specific senders, or other characteristics. Using this learning
						ability, these systems can straight link email messages to the correct folders. It can also mark
						emails like a user, or move between folders.</p>

					<h3>Natural language processing and chatterbots</h3>
					<h4 class="subtitle">What does it do?</h4>
					<p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics and artificial intelligence,
						particularly contributed to help computer understand, process and manipulate the statements and
						words in human language. In other words, natural language processing is the technology that
						program computers to answer questions the way humans do and allow them to give appropriate
						response, for example Siri and Alexa. These artificial intelligences can be classified as
						chatterbots. Chatterbots refer to computer science which generate automated responses to human’s
						inputs through conversation and written words. Importantly, chatterbots are depended on natural
						language processing. With NLP, chatterbots can learn to read, decipher, and interpret human
						written and spoken language and create narratives that describe, summarize, or interpret input
						(structured data) in a human-like manner. NLP is the driving force behind many of the AI
						solutions that users frequently interact with and enables understanding between humans and
						machines.</p>
					<p>So far, Natural Language Processing is booming in the best time in its history, as the technology
						continues to advance and integrate with various industries and implementations. The latest
						report showed that the market value of NLP achieved at USD 10.72 billion in 2021, predicting
						that it will be reached at about 48 billion in the next ten years (Natural Language Processing
						(NLP) Market | Growth, Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts (2021 - 2026), 2021). As humanity
						enters the age of intelligence, with unprecedented growth in smart devices and data volumes, the
						demand for human-computer interaction through speech and language is growing exponentially, and
						more influential cutting-edge research and technology innovations will emerge in the field of
						speech and natural language processing.</p>
					<p>Machine translate is the most fundamental application which interacted with natural language. It
						automatically translate text or speech from foreign language to native language. The traditional
						rules of process is based on the blending of language, grammar and related dictionaries.
						According to Devura and Jain (2020, p.3), until 2020, about a quarter of all enterprises have
						applied chatterbots processed by NLP into their customer services. It implies an importance and
						comprehensive use of chatterbots based on NLP in recent decades. Siri system is regarded as a
						typical representative of chatterbots. It is a dialogue system which is able to understand human
						language and return a response. </p>
					<p>The future trend of natural language processing is the deep integration of NLP with many fields,
						thus creating value for various related industries. The need for natural language processing is
						increasing in fields such as banking, electrical appliances and medicine. The closer NLP is
						integrated with various industries, the stronger the trend of specialized services will be In
						the field of medical and health care, natural language processing technology has a broad
						application prospect, such as the auxiliary entry of medical records, medical data retrieval and
						analysis, and auxiliary diagnosis, etc. Modern medical information is vast, and new medical
						methods and approaches are developing rapidly. No doctor or specialist can master all the
						medical developments, and natural language processing can help doctors quickly and accurately
						find the recent research progress of various difficult diseases, so that patients can enjoy the
						fruits of medical technology progress as soon as possible.
						Although the NLP technology has already applied in retrieving and extracting clinical
						information, it is also restricted and inadequate. Nadkari et.al. (2011) proposed that the
						medical NLP requires more precise understanding of terminology. This brings it back to the
						biggest challenge that NLP is facing, which is language ambiguity. Word sense disambiguation
						also requires a proper understanding of the textual context, conversational environment, and
						background information, which cannot be clearly modeled yet. These factors all contribute to the
						difficulties in NLP implementation. You must have access to large amounts of natural language
						data so that computers can interact extensively. Serving these interactions and bridging the gap
						between binary language and natural language, computational power is critical.
					</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">What is the likely impact?</h4>
					<p>Natural language processing plays an important role in all walks of life. It has been widely used
						in many businesses of customers in industries such as e-commerce, finance, logistics,
						healthcare, and culture and entertainment. It can help users build intelligent products such as
						content search, content recommendation, opinion recognition and analysis, text structuring, and
						dialogue bots, and is also able to customize personalized solutions through cooperation. On the
						one hand, the huge amount of information can provide more "materials" for computers to learn
						natural language; on the other hand, it also provides a broader application arena for NLP. For
						example, as an important application of NLP, search engines have gradually become an important
						tool for people to obtain information, and there are search engine giants represented by Google,
						Baidu, etc.; machine translation has also come from the laboratory to the common people;
						NLP-based Chinese input methods (such as Sogou, Microsoft, Google, etc.) have become essential
						tools for computer users; computers and cell phones with speech recognition are also gaining
						popularity The NLP-based Chinese input methods (such as Sogou, Microsoft and Google) have become
						essential tools for computer users. In terms of application, intelligent chatterbots are
						actually designed to cope with the information overload. After the users ask the question to the
						dialogue system in natural language, chatterbots can answer the question precisely and smoothly.
						Up to now, chatterbots are able to replace a large number of human customer service agent in all
						industries for simple technical problems and customer support.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">How will this affect you?</h4>
					<p>There are many scenarios in which NLP can be used. It enables machines to perform repetitive
						tasks that would otherwise be performed by humans, thus helping to scale up language-related
						tasks. With the explosive development of e-commerce, NLP plays an important role in the search
						result query. It helps to identify key words in order to acquire relevant information.
						Basically, when users entered products’ details into search box in Amazon, it fruitfully targets
						the exact products which save much time shopping for things outside. Additionally, NLP enables
						AI to communicate with people about everyday problems and matters, freeing up more time for
						humans to do higher-level strategic work. Based on the application scenarios of chatbots, there
						are 3 main types of chatbots. Question-answer system is usually used in home appliance control
						in smart home which makes human life more convenient and safer. A Dialogue System is usually
						oriented towards a task where the robot needs to interact with the user, even for multiple
						rounds. Finally, business resources need to be invoked to complete a task. For example, a bot
						that checks the weather. Casual chat is a kind of open domain chatting scenario, just like
						chatting between two friends without restricting the topic and content. Chatty bots are mainly
						used for personal assistants, entertainment and other scenarios, with typical representatives
						such as Microsoft Ice and Apple Siri.</p>

					<p><strong>Lanbo Gao</strong> has done so much for the report and team. As a team leader, she always
						patiently listened what confusion and worries that others felt about this group assignment. By
						respecting each other and well allocating the workload, she came up with several feasible
						solutions for the teams to keep team work going forward. With her excellent leadership and
						supervision, the work has been completed in time. She also demonstrated well planning and
						organizing skills in group work. </p>
					<p><strong>Yiwei Lin</strong> always helped to organize discussion for the team. Although she didn’t
						know much about HTML and CSS, she had tried every effort to learn coding skills. She made full
						of her advantage in report writing and information collection and would like to share her
						experience with team members. She always pushed and supported team members when it comes to
						solving team issues.</p>
					<p><strong>Haonan Jiang</strong> always came up with his valuable opinion in report discussion. He
						had finished his sections effectively and also showed great passion in help each team member
						with their writing errors. He participated actively in each team’s discussion and kept record of
						each meeting notes. Before work breakdown, he had prepared several materials for the team to
						view so that each member know what they could write regarding the particular section.</p>
					<p><strong>Erxun Liu</strong> was very good at encouraging other members to finish the job based on
						their best efforts. He knew how to maintain a good relationship and communication with others to
						complete the team work. He was always the first one to finish his sections in the team and is
						always ready to help others. He had facilitated to promotes team collaboration and working
						atmosphere.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Ruilin Li</strong> was a good team member. He was very cooperative and helpful in times
						of need. He was easy to get along with everyone in the team no matter what their position is.
						Being an active participant in each team discussion and always carefully listen to other’s
						opinion, he has showed his potentials in team coordinating. For any problems that team had
						faced, he always engaged to finding solution with team members.</p>
					<p>For our group, there are a lot of great jobs we did and something still need to be improved.
						Everyone in our group tried our best to make contribution to our group project. First of all,
						group members would like to learn from each other. Someone is good at coding while someone is
						good at academic writing, then we learned a lot from each other’s successful experience.
						Secondly, there is a great academic atmosphere in our group, every group member is more than
						happy to help others. Also, we had excellent method to solve conflicts. Once we meet differences
						in our group, we will organize a simple debate, and then all the team members will vote to make
						the final decision. However, there are also some insufficient we need to be improved in the
						future. Time planning is the first trouble since the start of this group assignment. Because
						everyone in the group has different class timetable, even some group members are located
						oversea, so we have limited time to organize group meeting. But we believed that adapting to the
						remote working mode is beneficial to our career. Another point is that everyone has different
						understanding on our group assignment. To solve this problem, seeking advice from tutor could be
						a good choice. The most significant problem is tracking work progress, due to the inconsistent
						work efficiency, a certain degree of delay was caused. The thing surprising us is that we
						completed such a complicated task in such a short time, all of us did not have relative
						experience before. We have learned the importance of teamwork, the collision of ideas between
						team members is far more efficient than personal inspiration. Organization, cooperation, and
						conflict solving in a team are more important than learning certain specific skills. We look
						forward to a more tacit cooperation in the future.</p>

						<h3>Group Process</h3>
						<p>In Assignment 2, all group members made a significant contribution to the group project.
							Firstly, the atmosphere of our group was quite harmonious and cooperative. As group members
							were unique individuals, it was common to hold different opinions while working together.
							However, we always had a small discussion at first, and then we voted to make a decision
							which was the most effective way to solve conflicts. Secondly, although the group project
							had a heavy workload, all group members assigned the large amount of work equally and
							rationally. Even if group members completed their parts early, they volunteered to help
							others if they had any difficulties in the project. We would like to persist these
							outstanding contributions in our next group assignment. Conversely, there are also some
							improvements that we can make in Assignment 3. The most important thing that we need to
							enhance is time management. Because it is close to the final term, we should reasonably
							schedule and plan our timetable in order to complete all assignments effectively with
							advanced quality. Additionally, a new group member joins our team in Assignment 3. We should
							adapt to the slight changes as soon as possible. It is crucial to build a reliable and tied
							bond with new group members which can boost our efficiency in a project.</p>

					<h3>Q: What common elements are there, if any? What differentiates each position from the others, if
						anything? How similar or different are your career plans across the group?</h3>
					<p>A: The common element for these ideal jobs is that they are all technically-related. They all
						require related technical or analytic experiences. Additionally, the collaborative abilities are
						all expected for the jobs’ requirements. Conversely, the difference is that some ideal jobs are
						more related to professional information technology skills. And other jobs only require relative

				<section class="qAndABox box style1">
					<h3>Individual Reflection</h3>
					<p style="padding-bottom:0"><strong>Lanbo Gao</strong></p>
					<p> I made a great contribution to this group assignment. I did much communication work with team
						members and tutor. To improve the quality of the assignment , I suggested changing another
						project and confirming the feasibility of the new project with the tutor. I advocate making
						changes according to feedback and optimizing the plan. In addition, I also play the role of
						meeting planner. Meeting is definitely a quite significant part of a group project. It is
						commonly believed as a fact that meeting with high-efficiency could be the drive in order to
						make progress. I coordinate meeting schedules and make meeting agenda. On the other hand, I have
						high requirements for my allocated work. I would like to listen to others when differences of
						opinion happen and reflect on myself. However, there is still something I need to improve. First
						of all, I think I need to improve my creativity. Exploring divergent thinking ability will be
						crucial to my career in the future, especially in the IT industry. After that, I believe I
						should enhance my coding ability. It is a very important foundation for my career. Finally,
						through the group assignment, I found that leadership is another soft skill I need to learn
						more.</p>
					<p style="padding-bottom:0"><strong>Yiwei Lin</strong></p>
					<p> I help my team members ease the embarrassment at the meeting, and every time each group member
						will participate in the meeting that is really good for the assignment. But we are doing our
						part of the time which is not always the plan time to complete, in this case we should improve,
						we assign each person to do part of the relatively average without objection. For the web page
						model, although it took a lot of time, the web page did not achieve the expected effect due to
						my limited skill and some late time to start the webPage. I have to say that it is a pity that I
						have not learned enough at ordinary times. In the future, I will make up for these deficiencies.
						As for my coding and communication skills, there is still a lot of space for improvement. If my
						coding skills are good enough, we do not need to use a website builder to help us build the
						website. Our group lost a member in the assignment2, but added a new member in the assignment3,
						which surprised me. </p>
					<p style="padding-bottom:0"><strong>Xingyu Zhou</strong></p>
					<p>For our assignment 3. Our group has a very smooth process to finish it. Every member has made a
						great contribution. When our team members assign tasks. Each of our team members can choose the
						appropriate part. One thing we can improve is the speed of finishing our assignment because most
						of our work is done in the last two weeks. One thing that surprised me is our group often has
						group discussions, and almost all members can participate in each discussion. Most of the team
						members are active in the process of completing this assignment</p>
					<p>For myself through this assignment, my ability to communicate and cooperate with other team
						members has improved. When some members put forward better opinions, I can correctly adopt their
						advantages. After finishing this assignment, I also have a deep understanding of our research
						project. I attended every group discussion on time. While listening to the suggestions of other
						team members, I can also put forward your own opinions. I can also quickly accomplish my part
						when I choose what I should do. What I can improve is the use and understanding of professional
						knowledge, especially programming ability. Improving these abilities will be very helpful for my
						future study career.</p>
					<p style="padding-bottom:0"><strong>Erxun Liu</strong></p>
					<p> In this project, Everyone in our team tried their best. Each of us has made a lot of
						contributions to this project. Everyone in our team has good communication. For my part, I'm
						doing well and tried my best. What needs to be improved is that in the future, everyone needs to
						speak more actively in the meeting. What surprises me is that everyone is very efficient in
						completing their work.
					</p>
					<p style="padding-bottom:0"><strong>Ruilin Li</strong></p>
					<p> In Assignment 3, all group members made the advanced efforts and outstanding contributions to
						the group project. We actively participate in group discussion and attend group meetings twice a
						week. Generally, the atmosphere of our group is extremely harmonious. Although there is friction
						due to different perspectives between group members, it can always be solved peacefully.
						Conversely, it is necessary to improve the efficiency of completing our project. Because it is
						the final week, all members have enormous work to do. It is important to reasonably make a plan
						and finish it on time.</p>
					<p>For my personal improvement, it was my first time to learn basic knowledge about Information
						Technology. It really surprised me when I first made the visual website. During the process of
						researching our project, I did a deep digging about online learning platforms and I gained
						substantial knowledge about it. More importantly, I learned from my group members. It taught me
						the most crucial thing for a group to operate properly was cooperation. By working in this way,
						it can accelerate the efficiency of the project. Finally, I was so happy to be in this group,
						thanks for everyone!</p>
					<p style="padding-bottom:0"><strong>Haonan Jiang</strong></p>
					<p> In this assignment I was responsible for the project planning, it helps me think more about this
						software. This task on app designing was aimed at providing the university with an app interface
						capable of hosting online classes and video conferences. While designing the app, I felt most
						intrigued about the Agile Development approach. According to me, although the process involves
						repeatedly making changes to the prototype based on the feedback received from users, I feel its
						importance lies in making the app perfect with time. Also, I would also like to discuss the app
						scope. According to me, besides the university audience, the app can be used in other areas such
						as corporate sectors where managers can train their teams through online conferences. However,
						care needs to be taken regarding the app budget which shall exceed its given threshold owing to
						the myriad of functionalities that the app might contain. On the whole, this learning app has
						significant potential in terms of both working and profitability. By making this app a
						successful product on the Play Store and App Store, people will be able to download the same and
						each download volume will yield revenue. Through further OTA updates, we can also include a
						number of premium features as well. Through group meetings, group members provided a lot of
						interesting ideas and helped me figure out what functions we should have in our software.
						Appreciate!</p>

					<h3>Group Reflection</h3>
					<p>We reflect on this group assignment by various aspects, containing our pros and cons, the
						challenge we meet, the experience we learned, etc. At the beginning of this assignment, we got
						feedback from the tutor which pointed out our last group assignment was not satisfactory due to
						lack of creativity. It was the first challenge we met. Thus, we held a meeting regarding the
						change of group project. Two new ideas were proposed, which are an online medical service
						platform and online education platform. After our discussion and voting by all group members, we
						decided to work on the second one because there is stronger feasibility and lower legal risk.
						Since we started to research this kind of IT project, we found that there is a big potential
						market for the online education industry, especially during pandemic COVID-19, the market has
						increased dramatically. It is exactly what surprised us, we chose the correct direction to do
						research and most group members are very interested in the project. To complete this project
						perfectly, we have great communication and cooperation among group members, everyone is free to
						participate in discussion or debate, we believe that brainstorming can be the best way for
						increasing our creativity. In addition, we have great resource integration capability. Every
						group member contributes relevant materials and references, and each member would choose what
						kind of reference needed according to their own part. In fact, this is an effective way for
						saving time. However, there are still a couple of things we need to improve. Through the process
						we collected data, we recognized that data analysis is crucial to industry research and
						investigation. Most group members lack data collection and analysis ability. Practical data
						analysis could help us realize the current situation of certain industries and be useful to
						decision making. Furthermore, data virtualization is more understandable to present. On the
						other hand, we need to pay more attention to the accuracy and reliability of the materials or
						data we quoted. From this group project, we recognized the importance of group cooperation.
						Everyone has their own skilled field and contributes to various aspects of the whole project. In
						sum, we made much progress in the process of working on this group project. Everyone has a
						deeper understanding of the industry and boosts the ability of foundation skills. We will
						overcome more challenges in the future.</p>
