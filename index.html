					<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
					<h4 class="subtitle">What does it do?</h4>
					<p>Cybersecurity means that the software and hardware of the data in the system and the network
						system are saved from being leaked, changed, or damaged by unexpected or vicious reasons. With a
						tried and continuous operation of the network service and the system can not be broken down.
					</p>
					<p>Network firewall technology is a particular interconnection network equipment, which is used to
						enhance the access control between networks, hinder the users of the outer network from
						iniquitously entering the internal network through the external network, access to the internal
						network resources, and protect the internal network operating environment. It checks packets
						transmitted between two or more networks, such as link patterns, according to inevitable
						security policies, to decide if the telecommunications between networks is allowed or not, and
						invigilators the working state of the network.</p>
					<p>At present, the firewall products mainly include fortress host, packet filter router,
						application layer gateway, circuit layer gateway, shielding host firewall, dual host, etc.
						Anti-virus software is definitely the most widely used security technology solution because the
						technology is the easiest to implement, but we all know is the main function of antivirus
						software antivirus, the function is very limited, can not fully meet the needs of network
						security, this way maybe can meet the needs of individuals or small businesses, but if
						individuals or businesses have the demand of electronic commerce, It can't be completely
						satisfied.
					</p>
					<p>Fortunately, with the continuous development of anti-virus software technology, the current
						mainstream anti-virus software can prevent the Trojan horse and other hacker programs. Other
						antivirus software developers also provide a software firewall, with a certain firewall
						function, to a certain extent can play the role of a hardware firewall, such as KV300, Golden
						Mountain firewall, Norton firewall, and so on.</p>
					<p>The security technology used in combination with firewall includes file encryption and digital
						signature technology, its purpose is to improve the security and confidentiality of information
						systems and data. One of the primary technical means to prevent secret data from being stolen,
						intercepted, or destroyed by outsiders. With the development of information technology, people
						be more and more concentrate on network security and information confidentiality.</p>
					<p>At present, in accretion to enhancing data security safeguard in law and management, countries
						have also taken estimates in hardware and software technology respectively. It promotes the
						continuous improvement of data encryption skills and physical protection skills. According to
						the different functions, file encryption and digital signature technology basically include data
						transmission, data storage, data integrity discrimination, and so on.</p>
					<p>Artificial intelligence technology will be the focus of the next round of technological
						revolution. With the rapid development of AI and other technologies, the resulting security
						problems are more of a priority for our network security industry. Similar to artificial
						intelligence technology, blockchain is also listed as an important emerging technology. In the
						current network security industry, its two sides are very obvious. In contrast, the network
						defense of blockchain is also recognized in the industry, and it is reported that it is the
						second line of defense in the network security industry. The ensuing blockchain security,
						ecological security, information security, etc., have also become more obvious and complex. Its
						regulation has lagged behind the pace of development and has caused numerous safety problems.
						Quantum technology is now also threatening the security of traditional encryption algorithms.
						Quantum communication and quantum computing are the two most widely used technologies in the
						field of network security, and they are most closely related to network security. 5G technology
						has officially entered the commercial stage, and its network security threats will also be
						derived from new security technologies. The Internet of Things has been a safe disaster area.
						The complementary and coordinated development of cloud computing, edge computing, and fog
						computing will also have an impact on the security industry.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">What is the likely impact?</h4>
					<p>Cybersecurity is important because the amount of data that governments, the military,
						corporations, monetary and iatrical organizations gather in, store, and process on computers and
						other devices are unprecedented. A significant part of this data could be serious information,
						whether literary property, monetary data, personal detail, or other types of data, where illegal
						employment or reveal can have negative results. Companies transfer sensitive data over networks
						or other equipment in the course of their business, and cybersecurity describes the discipline
						of defending that data and the systems used to process or store it. As the scale and complexity
						of cyber hacking increase, organizations and companies, peculiarly those reliable for protecting
						data related to national security, medical, or monetary archives, need to take action to secure
						their sensitive commerce and individual information. America's top intelligence staff have
						warned that cyber strikes and electronic espionage are the most serious intimidation to state
						security, eclipsing even terrorism.</p>
					<p>New technologies in the cybersecurity industry are either research in nature, national strategy,
						or market-driven. These three pieces should be the main source of driving force for new
						technologies in network security.</p>
					<p>In terms of the nature of research, the vulnerability research technologies and methods at the
						system level emerge in an endless stream. With the iteration of versions and the update of
						hardware technology, many new injection reverse methods and vulnerability mining technologies
						have emerged from the traditional Windows to iOS and Android.</p>
					<p>From the perspective of national strategy, cyberspace confrontation and interference between
						countries will promote security methods and countermeasures at all levels from terminals to
						networks to systems to tools, as well as new ideas and technologies such as DNS pollution, BGP
						hijacking, and software intrusion.</p>
					<p>Driven from the market, is the apparent compliance and forced to promote market-oriented domestic
						technical generation and development, compliance-driven from a full business chain from upstream
						to downstream, the technology is accurate for the security services technology, technology
						itself is not necessarily the security, the security of the code is most concerned about, market
						behavior is more meet compliance requirements, At the same time, as far as possible to their
						problems, so, from code static to business dynamic self-protection and other related to the user
						business, in the confrontation has been developing.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">How will this affect you?</h4>
					<p>While work-at-home attacks are not a new threat, it is only a matter of time before an attacker
						can infiltrate multiple, insecure home networks simultaneously, wreaking havoc on critical
						systems and services. It makes sense. With many employees using their home broadband connections
						for personal and work purposes, the scope for corporate attacks has increased considerably.</p>
					<p>Data reveals can contain economic information such as credit card numbers or bank account
						details, personal health detail, individually identifiable information, trade secrets,
						intellectual property. Other ways for data breach include unintentional, data breach, cloud
						breach, information breach.</p>
					<p>When we join a public Wi-Fi, we usually reveal the risk of stealing personal detail from an
						external source. For example, some hackers on the network are able to access our devices to grab
						our personal detail. They range from so-called "man-in-the-middle" attacks to attacks that
						create bogus Wi-Fi to collect data. In what is known as a "man-in-the-middle" attack, the
						connection between a user and a Wi-Fi will be hackers broken to steal private information. While
						the fake Wi-Fi networks are ones that hackers create, they will look really alike to a
						reasonable connection.</p>
					<p>Those hackers have access to reasonable names for Wi-Fi networks that look like what a business
						network would connect. For example, when the actual name of the network is "Starbucks Guest,"
						they may set a name like "Starbucks Guest."Hackers could use these networks to collect illegal
						data from those people who connect this connection. </p>

					<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
					<h4 class="subtitle">What does it do?</h4>
					<p>The autonomous vehicle is a kind of intelligent vehicle, also known as a wheeled mobile robot. It
						mainly relies on the computer system in the car, to reach the target of driving without the
						driver.
						The autonomous vehicle is a smart vehicle that able to latches the road environment by the
						onboard sensing system, plans the driving guidelines by the computers, and controls the vehicle
						to reach the scheduled target. Like so much else, Autonomous driving is a process of gradual
						technological development. There are also different stages of Autonomous driving.
					</p>
					<p>Stage one: the auxiliary driving stage. adaptive cruise, Lane-keeping, and other support driving
						capabilities are the technologies that we have at this stage, however, the navigator still is
						the main operator.</p>
					<p>Stage two: semi-autonomous. At this stage, the autonomous vehicle already can project the process
						of going to the destination in the computer calculation, and it also could serve as a backup
						system to support during the driving. However, due to the restriction of regulations and laws
						and other factors, it still can not occur as the main part of the driving.</p>
					<p>Stage three: Full self-driving. Technology, law, cost, and other factors cease to influence the
						popularity of the opportunities, computer control system has been the driving subject, the
						driver could take charge of the operating system anytime.</p>
					<p>Concerning automatic parking, the cause of vehicle damage is not a recurrent road accident, but a
						minor bump caused by parking. Parking can be the least critical driving behavior, but it may
						still make everything messy. Although several automakers are adding rear-view cameras and
						accelerometers that scale the distance of objects around them and through onboard computers that
						able to display what's on the sides of the car however some drivers are still bumping their way
						into parking spaces.</p>
					<p>The autonomous parking system is a major milestone of autonomous vehicles. With this system, the
						car is able to look into its surroundings similar to a driver, work at the right moment and
						travel securely from stop 1 to stop 2. While the technology isn't yet fully hands-off and
						letting the car drive you home, it's the first step in that direction.</p>
					<p>Since DARPA's ALV project in the 1980s, the most popular self-driving techniques we've seen are
						studded with sensors and have a lidar mounted on top of them. The vehicle uses sensors to detect
						and three-dimensional scans of lidar to 'sense' the world around it, while the onboard
						controlling computer acts like a human brain to decide what to do. Google's Autonomous vehicles
						are a good sample of lidar exhibitions.</p>
					<p>Google is regarded as the earliest Internet giant to Interdisciplinary to carry out the
						examination and exploit of autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, depending on their own map and big
						data computing resources, they really contain a leading benefit in this field. Google's
						autonomous vehicles use a 64-bit 3D lidar provided by Velodyne to create a 3D map of their
						circumstance. Combined with Google's senior-fidelity maps, Google's self-driving car uses a
						computer and a cloud network to process big data. Finally, realize the automatic driving
						function:</p>
					<p>Early test vehicles of the Toyota Prius were furnished with position sensors, range-ranging
						radar, video cameras, and lidar. Video cameras are used to estimate any traveling targets and
						traffic lights. LiDAR is also used to make 3D maps of actual highway conditions; Ranging radar
						is used to explore barriers on sides of the car. When a target approaches, the computer will
						voluntarily decrease the speed of the vehicle. The location transducer located on the left rear
						wheel detects and estimates the lateral deviation of the car to condition its position on the
						map.</p>
					<p>After years of efforts, Google has publicity its demo Autonomous vehicle. The sample is also
						loaded with radar and transducers, as much as a lidar installed on the top of the vehicle.
						Google's Autonomous vehicle, which has removed the steering wheel and is drive completely by an
						onboard computer, is the optimal thing even to an Autonomous car concept.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">What is the likely impact?</h4>
					<p>Professional drivers will be drastically reduced. Autonomous cars will reduce the need for truck
						drivers, taxi drivers, and other professional drivers. The human cost of large bus and truck
						drivers is not a small expenditure, and can not let each driver work too hard, work too long, to
						avoid the bad consequences of fatigue driving, and unmanned driving can be very good to
						alleviate or even solve this problem.</p>
					<p>Autonomous cars have reduced the traffic accident rate. There are statistics show that 1,200,000
						person die every single year from all over the world automotive or related to traffic accidents,
						of which 93% is caused by human error, and unmanned vehicles using on-board sensors to the
						surrounding environment, and according to the perceived position of road vehicles and obstacles
						of information control steering and speed of the vehicle, the vehicle on the road can safely and
						reliably and It can reduce the number of road accidents caused by careless mistakes and reduce
						the number of people killed.</p>
					<p>In many American cities, however, there are concerns that the development of autonomous driving
						will ruin their economies. These cities rely on revenue from car use to balance their budgets,
						which can amount to 15 to 50 percent of their city's transportation revenue: gasoline taxes,
						vehicle registration fees, and billions of dollars in parking revenue. But Autonomous cars do
						not incur these costs, and the city's finances will be in a large deficit. If the government is
						asked to bear the cost, it will certainly affect the investment in other public services.
						Therefore, they call on the government to stop the deployment of Autonomous cars. Others worry
						that, contrary to the large number of jobs created by Uber, Autonomous cars may make many newly
						paid drivers lose their jobs.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">How will this affect you?</h4>
					<p>Autonomous cars free up hands and save more personal time. With time not wasted driving, waiting
						for traffic lights, or looking for a parking space, we can use the extra commute time to check
						email, grab a coffee, take a nap, or video chat with a friend far away. Women can wake up later
						and move makeup and breakfast time to the car.</p>
					<p>No more worrying about look for a car park. The proliferation of Autonomous cars means we won't
						have to search for a parking space, as they will drive themselves to find the perfect spot after
						delivering us to our destination. Even if we buy an Autonomous car, we don't need to park
						because it can find a spot and park itself. This will alleviate the shortage of parking spaces
						in the city to a large extent.</p>
					<p>The private car may be on its way out. When the entire unmanned driving technology has been
						mature and applied to the public transport system, all the traffic will be uniformly scheduled
						in a system. When you need a car, the system will allocate the nearest car to pick you up at
						intervals. It is similar to the sharing concept of Uber. When you need a car, a shared
						Autonomous car will come to help you complete the travel request. For example, after you buy the
						weekend groceries, the Autonomous car that just sent you home will pick up the elderly people
						next door to the hospital immediately.</p>
					<p>Autonomous cars are used to shuttle children to various extracurricular activities after school.
						The car is equipped with monitors that allow parents to keep an eye on their children. Parents
						may prefer Autonomous cars to strangers picking up and dropping off their children.</p>
					<p>Autonomous cars have also appeared, with the main benefit of making roads safer. People who are
						elderly or unable to drive could also benefit from Autonomous cars.</p>

					<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
					<h4 class="subtitle">What does it do?</h4>
					<p>Technological innovation is the fundamental driving force of economic growth. The most important
						thing of these technologies is what economists refer to as "general-purpose technologies" such
						as the internal combustion engine, the steam engine, electricity, and so on. Artificial
						intelligence is undoubtedly the most important "general-purpose technology" of our era.
						Especially the combination of artificial intelligence and industry has released the potential of
						the industry and change our lives.</p>
					<p>"Machine learning" is the most important driving force behind the revolutionary advances in the
						field of artificial intelligence that has received so much attention.</p>
					<p>Machine learning is an interdisciplinary subject, which involves decision theory, algorithm
						complexity theory, experimental science, function approximation theory, optimization theory,
						cybernetics, computer science, probability statistics, and other disciplines. Therefore, there
						are many different definitions of machine learning, each of which is defined from the
						perspective of related disciplines. But in general, the core issue of its concern is how to
						simulate human-like learning behavior computationally: to take the rules (or models) from
						historical experience and apply them to new and similar scenarios.</p>
					<p>Decision trees and their variants are algorithms that divide the input area into many different
						regions, and each region has its independent parameters. The decision tree algorithm makes the
						best of the tree model, the root node to a leaf node is a separate classification of the path
						rules, each leaf node represents an independent judgment category. The samples are first divided
						into different parts, and then the segmentation recursion is executed until each subset gets
						samples of the same type. The prediction category can be gotten by starting the test from the
						root node to the subtree and then to the leaf node. This method has a simple structure and high
						efficiency of data processing.</p>
					<p>An artificial neural network is similar to an unusually complex network of neurons, consisting of
						individual interconnected units, each of which has a numerical input and output, either in the
						form of a real number or a linear combination function. It has to learn in a discipline of
						learning before it can work. When a network makes a wrong judgment, it can learn to make it less
						likely to make the same mistake. This method has strong generalization ability and nonlinear
						mapping ability and can model the system with little information. From the point of view of
						functional simulation, it has parallelism, and the speed of information transmission is
						extremely fast.</p>
					<p>In the process of machine learning, parameter estimation methods such as maximum likelihood
						estimation are needed. In the case of potential variables, the EM algorithm is usually chosen,
						which does not directly estimate the maximum of the function object but adds some data for
						simplified calculation and then carries out maximization simulation. It is a maximum likelihood
						estimation algorithm for data that are limited by the experience or difficult to be processed
						directly in the field of machine learning, deep learning is a recent research direction, which
						is presented into machine learning to achieve it closer to the initial target artificial
						intelligence (AI).</p>
					<p>The purpose of deep learning is to study the inherent rules and representation steps of a sample
						target, and the information captured during the process of studying is a benefit for helping the
						explanation of data such as words, graphs, and voice. The final aim is for machines to be as
						thinking and studying as real humans, can identify those data are collected such as texts,
						photos, and voices. Deep learning is a sophisticated machine learning arithmetic that has far
						overcome antecedent technologies in voice and graph identification.</p>
					<p>Deep learning has already achieved several efforts in search skills, natural language processing,
						machine learning, multimedia learning, data mining, machine translation, individuation
						technologies, big data analysis, and recommendation, voice identifies, and other related fields.
						Deep learning empowers machines to simulate human activities such as audio-visual and make
						choice, settles several hard pattern identification issues, and realizes significantly
						improvement in artificial intelligence-related technologies.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">What is the likely impact?</h4>
					<p>The IT giants are deeply studying and applying machine learning, aiming to fully imitate the
						human brain, in an attempt to create machine brains with human intelligence.</p>
					<p>In 2012, Google issued epochal manufacture in the area of artificial intelligence, a demic brain
						emulation software with self-learning abilities. Emulation brain cell communication and learn to
						recognize dogs, humans, and other kinds of stuff by observing YouTube videos. When data is
						passed to this neural network, the connections between different neurons influence. This also
						affords the neural network to learn how to react to some data. The connection is knowing to have
						learned something, and Google is anticipated to utilize the ultramodern technology in several
						fields, with speech identification likely to benefit first.</p>
					<p>As genomes and other sorting programs run on to expand, the center of bioinformatics research is
						removaling from backlogging information to enplaning it. after a short while, discoveries in
						biology will rely quite on our analytical capacity to combine and correlate varying data across
						multiple magnitudes and at different scales, instead of just sustained to concern on
						conventional areas. order data will be comprehensive with configuration and functional data on
						gene utterance, biochemical mechanism data on phenotype, and clinical data. With such a
						significant number of data, there is an emergency need for the improvement of academic
						arithmetic and software in the repository, procurement, processing, look through, and imagery of
						biological information. on the side, because of the sophistication of genome data itself, there
						is an emergency necessity for the improvement of academic arithmetic and software. nevertheless,
						machine learning methods such as genetic algorithms neural networks, neural networks, support
						vector machines, and decision trees are appropriate for behavior with such areas with a
						significant number of data, noise, and lack of unified theory.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">How will this affect you?</h4>
					<p>You can use spoken commands to ask the phone to perform tasks such as searching or making calls,
						and these functions rely on machine learning. Virtual personal assistants such as Siri, Alexa,
						and Google Assistant are all able to follow spoken commands because they recognize speech. They
						can process natural human language and match it with expected instructions and responses in
						increasingly natural ways. These intelligent assistants can learn a lot of conversations in
						different ways. They can be asked for specific information, such as how to read your name or
						identify the owner of a voice in a room. A large number of conversations from the users they use
						become sample data to help an intelligent assistant identify words that sound different, or how
						to create a natural discussion.</p>
					<p>Many of us are already familiar with shopping recommendations, such as supermarkets reminding you
						to add cheese to an online store or Amazon suggesting books you might like. Machine learning
						allows Amazon to offer recommendations to individual shoppers through what's called a
						recommendation system. By analyzing users' previous shopping data and various preference
						expressions, the recommendation system can record users' purchasing history patterns. They use
						this model to predict what you're likely to buy.</p>
					<p>Machine learning can also be used to distinguish between different labels of items or objects.
						Artificial intelligence is playing an important role in filtering out spam emails. This
						technique is especially beneficial for sorting out the emails you ask from the ones you don't
						want to read. Spam discovery systems can use sample mail to filter spam and identify spam by
						finding specific words, names of specific senders, or other characteristics. Using this learning
						ability, these systems can straight link email messages to the correct folders. It can also mark
						emails like a user, or move between folders.</p>

					<h3>Natural language processing and chatterbots</h3>
					<h4 class="subtitle">What does it do?</h4>
					<p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics and artificial intelligence,
						particularly contributed to help computer understand, process and manipulate the statements and
						words in human language. In other words, natural language processing is the technology that
						program computers to answer questions the way humans do and allow them to give appropriate
						response, for example Siri and Alexa. These artificial intelligences can be classified as
						chatterbots. Chatterbots refer to computer science which generate automated responses to human’s
						inputs through conversation and written words. Importantly, chatterbots are depended on natural
						language processing. With NLP, chatterbots can learn to read, decipher, and interpret human
						written and spoken language and create narratives that describe, summarize, or interpret input
						(structured data) in a human-like manner. NLP is the driving force behind many of the AI
						solutions that users frequently interact with and enables understanding between humans and
						machines.</p>
					<p>So far, Natural Language Processing is booming in the best time in its history, as the technology
						continues to advance and integrate with various industries and implementations. The latest
						report showed that the market value of NLP achieved at USD 10.72 billion in 2021, predicting
						that it will be reached at about 48 billion in the next ten years (Natural Language Processing
						(NLP) Market | Growth, Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts (2021 - 2026), 2021). As humanity
						enters the age of intelligence, with unprecedented growth in smart devices and data volumes, the
						demand for human-computer interaction through speech and language is growing exponentially, and
						more influential cutting-edge research and technology innovations will emerge in the field of
						speech and natural language processing.</p>
					<p>Machine translate is the most fundamental application which interacted with natural language. It
						automatically translate text or speech from foreign language to native language. The traditional
						rules of process is based on the blending of language, grammar and related dictionaries.
						According to Devura and Jain (2020, p.3), until 2020, about a quarter of all enterprises have
						applied chatterbots processed by NLP into their customer services. It implies an importance and
						comprehensive use of chatterbots based on NLP in recent decades. Siri system is regarded as a
						typical representative of chatterbots. It is a dialogue system which is able to understand human
						language and return a response. </p>
					<p>The future trend of natural language processing is the deep integration of NLP with many fields,
						thus creating value for various related industries. The need for natural language processing is
						increasing in fields such as banking, electrical appliances and medicine. The closer NLP is
						integrated with various industries, the stronger the trend of specialized services will be In
						the field of medical and health care, natural language processing technology has a broad
						application prospect, such as the auxiliary entry of medical records, medical data retrieval and
						analysis, and auxiliary diagnosis, etc. Modern medical information is vast, and new medical
						methods and approaches are developing rapidly. No doctor or specialist can master all the
						medical developments, and natural language processing can help doctors quickly and accurately
						find the recent research progress of various difficult diseases, so that patients can enjoy the
						fruits of medical technology progress as soon as possible.
						Although the NLP technology has already applied in retrieving and extracting clinical
						information, it is also restricted and inadequate. Nadkari et.al. (2011) proposed that the
						medical NLP requires more precise understanding of terminology. This brings it back to the
						biggest challenge that NLP is facing, which is language ambiguity. Word sense disambiguation
						also requires a proper understanding of the textual context, conversational environment, and
						background information, which cannot be clearly modeled yet. These factors all contribute to the
						difficulties in NLP implementation. You must have access to large amounts of natural language
						data so that computers can interact extensively. Serving these interactions and bridging the gap
						between binary language and natural language, computational power is critical.
					</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">What is the likely impact?</h4>
					<p>Natural language processing plays an important role in all walks of life. It has been widely used
						in many businesses of customers in industries such as e-commerce, finance, logistics,
						healthcare, and culture and entertainment. It can help users build intelligent products such as
						content search, content recommendation, opinion recognition and analysis, text structuring, and
						dialogue bots, and is also able to customize personalized solutions through cooperation. On the
						one hand, the huge amount of information can provide more "materials" for computers to learn
						natural language; on the other hand, it also provides a broader application arena for NLP. For
						example, as an important application of NLP, search engines have gradually become an important
						tool for people to obtain information, and there are search engine giants represented by Google,
						Baidu, etc.; machine translation has also come from the laboratory to the common people;
						NLP-based Chinese input methods (such as Sogou, Microsoft, Google, etc.) have become essential
						tools for computer users; computers and cell phones with speech recognition are also gaining
						popularity The NLP-based Chinese input methods (such as Sogou, Microsoft and Google) have become
						essential tools for computer users. In terms of application, intelligent chatterbots are
						actually designed to cope with the information overload. After the users ask the question to the
						dialogue system in natural language, chatterbots can answer the question precisely and smoothly.
						Up to now, chatterbots are able to replace a large number of human customer service agent in all
						industries for simple technical problems and customer support.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">How will this affect you?</h4>
					<p>There are many scenarios in which NLP can be used. It enables machines to perform repetitive
						tasks that would otherwise be performed by humans, thus helping to scale up language-related
						tasks. With the explosive development of e-commerce, NLP plays an important role in the search
						result query. It helps to identify key words in order to acquire relevant information.
						Basically, when users entered products’ details into search box in Amazon, it fruitfully targets
						the exact products which save much time shopping for things outside. Additionally, NLP enables
						AI to communicate with people about everyday problems and matters, freeing up more time for
						humans to do higher-level strategic work. Based on the application scenarios of chatbots, there
						are 3 main types of chatbots. Question-answer system is usually used in home appliance control
						in smart home which makes human life more convenient and safer. A Dialogue System is usually
						oriented towards a task where the robot needs to interact with the user, even for multiple
						rounds. Finally, business resources need to be invoked to complete a task. For example, a bot
						that checks the weather. Casual chat is a kind of open domain chatting scenario, just like
						chatting between two friends without restricting the topic and content. Chatty bots are mainly
						used for personal assistants, entertainment and other scenarios, with typical representatives
						such as Microsoft Ice and Apple Siri.</p>

						Problem needs to be solved
					</h1>
					<p>
						In present days, the main problem has become to have access to
						food during the pandemic of Covid 19. At this point, people are
						struggling between the second wave of COVID-19 where citizens
						are being more cautious about stepping out of their house. While
						people are maintaining social distancing by a large extent,
						there are certain cases where people are needed to go outside
						to acquire food. At that point of time, they can be in contact
						with this virus. In this case, the global economy is deteriorating
						significantly and restaurant industry in the country of Australia
						is facing a great loss. Therefore it is the responsibility of Australians
						to save its economy. In this proper solution to this problem is needed.
					</p>
					<h1>
						Overview
					</h1>
					<p>
						In order to recover from this situation, smartphone applications for food
						ordering can be developed through which the restaurant can update its
						traditional menu ordering system with a smart menu ordering system
						(Cha and Seo, 2020). In this manner, the users or the guests who
						are coming to the restaurant do not have to touch their mem card which
						can contain COVID virus. At this point, this application can assist the
						restaurants to embrace zero-contact service to people of Australia for
						combatting this deadly pandemic.
					</p>
					<h1>
						Motivation
					</h1>
					<p>
						It is fortunate that Australia country is one the verge of being in a better
						position, whereas the other countries are facing the second wave. At this
						point, people of this country still need to take precautions carefully in
						order to avoid the extensive spread of this pandemic. At this point, digital
						innovation is that particular aspect which can assist people in maintaining
						social distance from each other. In this regard, digital menu ordering systems
						can help them in adhering to co contact principles throughout the pandemic.
						In addition to this, people can take control of their activities while going
						out to any restaurants.
					</p>
					<h1>
						Target market
					</h1>
					<p>
						After severe consequences of COVID-19, people have started going out again.
						In this case, the main target market for this application is mostly people
						of Australia who are eager to eat any restaurant while following precautionary
						measures for obstructing the spread of COVID-19. Under the circumstances, place
						demographic attributes can be considered as the main target since people of
						any age and employment status or any other aspects can come to restaurants.
						In addition to this, the other customer group can be identified as a target
						market who have a smartphone. Since the entire project revolves around smartphones,
						so people of Australia with smartphones can be a greater target market for
						this application.
					</p>
					<h1>
						Technical specification
					</h1>
					<h4>
						Hardware requirements
					</h4>
					<p>
						There are external hardware devices can be utilized in this proposed application.
						Two mobile phones and a computer must be used for the proceeding of this application
						related to the restaurant menu ordering system. Each of the devices should be immune
						to COVID-19 spread and proper caution must be used while operating these devices.
						The smartphones will be used for two end user requirements (core.ac.uk, 2021). The
						first one can be used by the users or the guests who will be coming to the restaurants.
						And, the other one will be used from the restaurant side in order to take orders and
						other attributes. In this case, computer system will be used as one back end server
						which can store the application databases and back-end program of the application.
						Therefore, it is mandatory that the information will be stored only in the computer
						server not in those two smartphones.
					</p>
					<h4>
						Software requirements
					</h4>
					<p>
						For designing the interface of this ordering application, MIT App Inventor can be used.
						Certain development languages are required for designing the background program for this
						application. In this case, python or java can be effective. APII interface design along
						with database applications, database software libraries such as SQLite must be utilized
						for backend programming of this menu ordering application. Python can be used for managing
						databases including storing user information (Bhargave et al., 2013). For this advanced
						application, user information can include user details, login credentials, restaurant
						menus and so on. Furthermore, encryption mechanisms must be used for encrypting personal
						information of users along with password encryption. In this regard, RSA algorithm can be
						used for the effectiveness of this application.
					</p>
					<h4>
						Skill requirements
					</h4>
					<p>
						Extensive knowledge about programming languages such as python or java must be acquired
						for developing source code for this menu ordering application for restaurants. Furthermore,
						several aspects of API and database management system plus query language must be known for
						proper development of this application. In case of API, the functions of an API such as Google
						Map API must be known for designing this independently. Database management system knowledge
						can help in carrying out activities related to database engines such as SQLite. Encryption
						technologies should also be covered for encrypting personal user information for this
						application.
					</p>
					<h1>
						Description
					</h1>
					<h4>
						User application
					</h4>
					<p>
						Initially user registration or user login page must be developed so that users can have access
						to
						their individual private account for the restaurants. For this, user information like user name,
						address, phone number must be put into the system. Although these private information are
						collected,
						the data will be stored in a database server through encryption technology for security
						purposes.
						If the user is frequent in any restaurant then the user preference will also be stored along
						with
						recommended menu items making it easy for the users to order (Patil et al., 2017). After
						selecting
						the restaurant they have gone to, they can see dinning time, number of people who are dining in
						so
						that they can make a choice of whether they desire to eat at that restaurant or not. Customer
						rating
						facilities must be added in this application for other customers to know about the protocols of
						restaurants. Since, there can be several restaurants, a particular sort index must be added
						which
						can show a range of restaurants based on service rank, business hours, score and current
						distance.
						In case the users need assistance during their meal they can also call waiter from the waiter
						service
						function designed for providing real time communication facilities.
					</p>

					<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px">Figure 1: Flow chart of
						application </p>
					<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px">(Source: irjet.net, 2021)</p>
					<h4>
						Restaurant side application
					</h4>
					<p>
						From restaurant side application, the login interface must be designed for the restaurants.
						Logging
						into their personal accounts, restaurants can edit its contact number, address, number of people
						currently
						dining, maximum number of people, business hours, menu orders and additional information
						(iaetsdjaras, 2021).
						Through Google Map API the restaurants can add their address and directions to get their.
						Additionally, restaurants
						can display its introduction along with its signature dishes, the number of customers who are in
						line and the
						hygiene protocols followed by the restaurants for the customers who are inclined towards
						avoiding contact with
						anyone. Menu options can present options based on different filters and sorting procedures such
						as lower price
						first or higher price first. Furthermore for frequent customers their previously ordered items
						can additionally
						be present there. Dishes ordering based on different flavors can also be generated for
						accessibility of customers.
					</p>
					<h4>
						Payment application
					</h4>
					<p>
						Online payment application modules can reduce human touch to a large extent because of cashless
						transactions.
						In payment application, relevant API functionalities of banks must be obtained. At this point,
						bank details
						of the users must be collected for initiating transactions (Li et al., 2020). After completing
						the transaction
						from the bank side, an automated bill must be generated. This bill information will be stored by
						both
						customer end and restaurant end.
					</p>
					<h1>
						Outcome
					</h1>
					<p>
						This developed smartphone restaurant menu ordering system can improve the traditional ordering
						system which is prone
						to human contact because of high dependence upon paper based processes (Munene and Kasamani,
						2018). The concerned
						solution can assist the customers in ordering their foods at any restaurants at their basic
						comfort while reducing
						human contact due to transaction bills, menu cards and other aspects. Furthermore the customers
						can be able to know
						about restaurants’ current business timing, customer gatherings in order to avoid larger
						gatherings which can spread
						COVID 19. The implementation technologies such as DBMS, SQLite, Python, Java and API can provide
						technical advancement
						to menu ordering systems which can follow the basic rule of COVID19 precaution such as social
						distancing. Therefore,
						it can be conjectured that this application can provide customers who are particularly concerned
						about their restaurant
						choices during this pandemic. Therefore the safety ratings, business conditions and other
						attributes can assist customers
						in making suitable restaurant choices.
					</p>
					<h1>
						Feasibility of project
					</h1>
					<p>
						This menu ordering application can attest to development of current customer trends towards,
						real-time and convenient
						technological innovation. In this case, the menu ordering system through smartphones can
						substitute the utilization of paper
						which is inconvenient and critical in present COVID 19 circumstances (Aulia et al., 2017).
						Through this application, both
						customers and restaurants can be benefited in their respective context such as dining in a safe
						restaurant and improving
						business productivity.

					<p><strong>Lanbo Gao</strong> has done so much for the report and team. As a team leader, she always
						patiently listened what confusion and worries that others felt about this group assignment. By
						respecting each other and well allocating the workload, she came up with several feasible
						solutions
						for the teams to keep team work going forward. With her excellent leadership and supervision,
						the
						work has been completed in time. She also demonstrated well planning and organizing skills in
						group
						work. </p>
					<p><strong>Yiwei Lin</strong> always helped to organize discussion for the team. Although she didn’t
						know much about HTML and CSS, she had tried every effort to learn coding skills. She made full
						of
						her advantage in report writing and information collection and would like to share her
						experience
						with team members. She always pushed and supported team members when it comes to solving team
						issues.</p>
					<p><strong>Haonan Jiang</strong> always came up with his valuable opinion in report discussion. He
						had
						finished his sections effectively and also showed great passion in help each team member with
						their
						writing errors. He participated actively in each team’s discussion and kept record of each
						meeting
						notes. Before work breakdown, he had prepared several materials for the team to view so that
						each
						member know what they could write regarding the particular section.</p>
					<p><strong>Erxun Liu</strong> was very good at encouraging other members to finish the job based on
						their best efforts. He knew how to maintain a good relationship and communication with others to
						complete the team work. He was always the first one to finish his sections in the team and is
						always
						ready to help others. He had facilitated to promotes team collaboration and working atmosphere.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Ruilin Li</strong> was a good team member. He was very cooperative and helpful in times
						of
						need. He was easy to get along with everyone in the team no matter what their position is. Being
						an
						active participant in each team discussion and always carefully listen to other’s opinion, he
						has
						showed his potentials in team coordinating. For any problems that team had faced, he always
						engaged
						to finding solution with team members.</p>
					<p>For our group, there are a lot of great jobs we did and something still need to be improved.
						Everyone
						in our group tried our best to make contribution to our group project. First of all, group
						members
						would like to learn from each other. Someone is good at coding while someone is good at academic
						writing, then we learned a lot from each other’s successful experience. Secondly, there is a
						great
						academic atmosphere in our group, every group member is more than happy to help others. Also, we
						had
						excellent method to solve conflicts. Once we meet differences in our group, we will organize a
						simple debate, and then all the team members will vote to make the final decision. However,
						there
						are also some insufficient we need to be improved in the future. Time planning is the first
						trouble
						since the start of this group assignment. Because everyone in the group has different class
						timetable, even some group members are located oversea, so we have limited time to organize
						group
						meeting. But we believed that adapting to the remote working mode is beneficial to our career.
						Another point is that everyone has different understanding on our group assignment. To solve
						this
						problem, seeking advice from tutor could be a good choice. The most significant problem is
						tracking
						work progress, due to the inconsistent work efficiency, a certain degree of delay was caused.
						The
						thing surprising us is that we completed such a complicated task in such a short time, all of us
						did
						not have relative experience before. We have learned the importance of teamwork, the collision
						of
						ideas between team members is far more efficient than personal inspiration. Organization,
						cooperation, and conflict solving in a team are more important than learning certain specific
						skills. We look forward to a more tacit cooperation in the future.</p>
